# 100 Days of KQL 2026 Inititave

- Create a readme.md and add this line to your readme: # #100DaysOfKQL2026 Master repo with instructions: https://github.com/m4nbat/100_days_of_kql_2026/
- Produce a query each day (if you create a few up front and then just publish each day, this is okay - we all have lives and other stuff to do). - Threat reports are a good source or initial crib off others posting in the community. Start small and work up. It doesn't have to be super sophisticated.

- Learn and get better at producing KQL queries and performing threat research
The best completed challenge repos will get Bridewell 1337 challenge coins. Some of the first people ever to receive this unique coin.
